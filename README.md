Ting Museum, an immersive NFT art metaverse experience venue. Ting Museum is dedicated to providing users with a new combination of science fiction visual, 
auditory and gaming experience, presenting the most avant-garde, interesting and high-end immersive meta-universe. 
Users can choose from cool skins such as "Space Odyssey 2001" and "Will the Bionic Man Smell Electronic Jasmine?" 
to decorate their personal gallery; they can also choose certain authorized music pieces from the music clips specially produced by the platform's partner musicians, 
making their online virtual gallery a rich five-sensory experience.

In addition, Ting Museum has also opened a music mini-game with VR experience, 
the audience will get a game experience similar to "Taiko Drummer" through mouse operation or VR tapping the screen.  
By completing tasks or accumulating points, users will be able to, from time to time, 
win prizes of AI artist Alice's paintings or limited edition of exclusive gallery soundtrack or display.
